    Imagine a world encapsulated inside a sphere such that gravity - rather than
    attracting towards the center of mass - instead repels outwards. What would
    walking in such a counterintuitive world feel like? How would people inhabit
    and develop this world over time? What kind of stories does this world have
    to tell?

    This non-Newtonian, non-Euclidean premise formed the basis for HYPONORMAL, a
    barren desert microworld battered and beaten by perpetual sandstorms. You
    are granted a unique opportunity to tread across these unforgiving lands and
    experience the spherical prison that eternally tethers you - and the ones
    who fell before you - to the ground.
