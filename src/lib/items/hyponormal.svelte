    Imagine a world encapsulated inside a sphere such that gravity - rather
    than attracting towards the center of mass - instead repels outwards. What
    would walking in such a counterintuitive world feel like? How would people
    inhabit and develop this world over time? What kind of stories does this
    world have to tell?

    This non-Newtonian, non-Euclidean premise formed the basis for HYPONORMAL,
    a barren desert microworld battered and beaten by perpetual sandstorms. You
    are granted a unique opportunity to tread across these unforgiving lands
    and experience the spherical prison that eternally tethers you - and the
    ones who fell before you - to the ground.
